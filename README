Dear old-school gamer,

I hope you have as much fun playing this game as I had writing it. I wrote
this game during April and May of 2005 while living in Russia.

This game was inspired by the original Taito Space Invaders from 1978, and
is dedicated to the MAME team (http://www.mame.net). Through their great
effort and generosity, it's possible to play these great old arcade games
which would otherwise be lost to memory.

I originally had the idea to write Invasion 3D during the summer of 2004. I
was playing the original Space Invaders on MAME, and was amazed at how good
the gameplay is, but frustrated because I could only shoot one bullet at a
time! So I decided to write a modern 3-D accelerated Space Invaders game
which would allow for as many bullets as I could shoot, and massive alien
carnage.

Thusly was Invasion 3D born. Since I appreciate the value of free software, I
also decided to use the open source SDL library and make this game portable
across operating systems, and as a result this game is playable under Windows,
Linux, OSX, and FreeBSD.
